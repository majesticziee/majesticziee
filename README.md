## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm AHMAD AZIZIE ADNAN
I'm a beginner **developer** who really enjoys exploring the world of coding.  
I started my journey by learning how to build simple projects, and now I focus on creating **WhatsApp Bots**, **Telegram Bots**, and **basic Websites**.  

Even though I'm still learning, I love experimenting with code, trying new features, and building tools that can be useful or just fun to use.  
My main goal right now is to keep improving my skills in **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, and **Web Development**, while also learning more about automation and APIs.  

I believe that being a developer is not only about writing code, but also about solving problems and creating something meaningful, no matter how small it is.
